# Unified Agent & Skill Orchestration

**Date:** 2026-03-28
**Status:** Approved

## Problem

Agents and skills are duplicated across 3 platform directories (`.claude/`, `.codex/`, `.config/opencode/`). The body content is identical — only YAML frontmatter differs per platform (model, temperature, occasionally description). This duplication causes drift, makes updates error-prone, and scales poorly as new platforms are added.

## Decision

Introduce a single source of truth under `src/agents/` and `src/skills/` with no frontmatter. An `agents.config.json` file defines all metadata and platform-specific overrides. A Node.js build script (`build.js`) generates the platform-specific output directories.

## Build Script Behavior (`build.js`)

### Agent Build

For each platform defined in `platforms`, for each agent in `agents`:

1. Read `src/agents/{agentName}.md` (pure body content)
2. Compute frontmatter by deep-merging in order:
   - `platforms[platform].defaults` (base: model, temperature)
   - Agent shared fields: `{ name: agentName, description, color }`
   - `agents[agentName].overrides[platform]` (platform-specific overrides)
3. Serialize as YAML frontmatter + `---\n` + body content
4. Prepend `<!-- GENERATED FILE — DO NOT EDIT. Source: src/agents/{name}.md -->\n` as an HTML comment
5. Write to `{outputDir}/agents/{agentName}.md`

### Skill Build

Skills are content-identical across platforms — no frontmatter transformation needed:

1. For each platform, recursively copy `src/skills/` → `{outputDir}/skills/`
2. Preserve directory structure (e.g., `fastify/` with its rule subdirectories)

### Merge Logic

```
finalFrontmatter = {
  ...platformDefaults,        // e.g. { model: "sonnet" }
  name: agentName,            // derived from filename
  description: agent.description,
  color: agent.color,
  ...agent.overrides[platform] // e.g. { temperature: 0.4 }
}
```

Null/undefined values are omitted from the output frontmatter (e.g., if temperature is not set for Claude, it won't appear).

## Workflow

```
Edit source          Edit config           Run build
src/agents/*.md  +  agents.config.json  →  node build.js
                                            ↓
                              .claude/  .codex/  .config/opencode/
                                            ↓
                              sync-local-agents.sh (deploy locally)
```

## What Changes

| Item | Before | After |
|------|--------|-------|
| Agent source | 3 copies in platform dirs | 1 copy in `src/agents/` |
| Skill source | 3 copies in platform dirs | 1 copy in `src/skills/` |
| Metadata | Embedded in each file's frontmatter | Centralized in `agents.config.json` |
| Adding a new agent | Create 3 files with different frontmatter | Create 1 file + 1 config entry |
| Adding a new platform | Copy all agents, change all frontmatter | Add 1 platform entry in config |
| `sync-local-agents.sh` | Unchanged | Unchanged |
| `.gitignore` | No changes needed — generated dirs stay tracked for tool compatibility |

## Edge Cases

- **Name inconsistency:** Current `secops-auditor` (Claude) vs `secops-security-auditor` (Codex/OpenCode). Unified to `secops-auditor` as the canonical filename. The `name` field in frontmatter will match the filename.
- **Description variants:** `backend-engineer` has an expanded description in Codex/OpenCode with usage examples. The unified description includes the examples (richer is better).
- **Skills with subdirectories:** `fastify/` has 17+ rule subdirectories. These are copied recursively as-is.

## Out of Scope

- CLAUDE.md, AGENTS.md, GEMINI.md, WARP.md, README.md updates (can be done separately)
- CI/CD integration for the build step
- Automated validation of config schema
